YouTube Timestamp Bookmarker ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Data Collection

**We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data or user information.**

This extension operates entirely locally on your device. All data is stored locally using Chrome's built-in storage API and never leaves your computer.

## What Data is Stored Locally

The extension stores the following information locally on your device:

- **Video bookmarks**: Timestamps you bookmark in YouTube videos
- **Bookmark notes**: Optional notes you add to bookmarks
- **Video titles**: Titles of videos you have bookmarked
- **Video IDs**: YouTube video IDs for organizing bookmarks

This data is stored in Chrome's local storage on your device and is never transmitted to any external servers or third parties.

## Permissions Used

The extension requires the following permissions:

- **Storage**: To save your bookmarks locally on your device
- **ActiveTab**: To access the current YouTube video page when you click the extension icon
- **Scripting**: To inject the bookmark button into YouTube pages
- **Host Permissions (youtube.com)**: To access YouTube video pages and add bookmark functionality

## Data Sharing

**We do NOT share, sell, or transfer any data to third parties.**

All data remains on your device and is never transmitted to external servers.

## Remote Code

This extension does NOT use remote code. All JavaScript code is included in the extension package and runs locally.

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control:

- You can delete bookmarks at any time through the extension popup
- You can uninstall the extension, which will remove all stored bookmarks
- All data is stored in Chrome's local storage, which you can clear through Chrome settings
